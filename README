Word By Word

As of 2012, this program does not work, because Google has ended free access to the 
Google Translate API. 

The program originally allowed the user to translate single words on a web page, 
quickly, by clicking on them. It was to aid in the learning of foreign languages. 

It was a Google Chrome browser extension.
